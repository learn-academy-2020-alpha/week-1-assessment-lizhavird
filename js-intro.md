# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer:
  
  A function allows you to make your computer preform an action, or return a value. 
  
  Researched answer:
  
A function is a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.
Most programming languages come with a prewritten set of functions that are kept in a library. You can also write your own functions to perform specialized tasks.


2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer:
  
.map maps a value to an specific index of an array. .filter filters values in an array that meet/do not meet specific requirements.

  Researched answer:
  
The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. The filter method is well suited for particular instances where the user must identify certain items in an array that share a common characteristic.
The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The map method allows items in an array to be manipulated to the userâ€™s preference, returning the conclusion of the chosen manipulation in an entirely new array.

3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer:
  
  console.log() logs the results of a function. console.log() does not have any effect on how a function runs, just how it is viewed by the user.
  return is an integral part of a function. all functions need a return, or input/output.
  
  Researched answer:
  
The main purpose of the return value, is to use the function return value like you would have use a variable value.

the console.log(); is a function that will write the argument value on the console. And only the debuging console, in a browser you will not see anything on the screen.

4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer:
  
an argument is a variable related to a function?

  Researched answer:
  
In programming, a value that is passed between programs, subroutines or functions. Arguments are independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes. When an argument is used to customize a program for a user, it is typically called a "parameter." See argc.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
  Paired programmers should code at alternating timed intervals.
  Pairs should also be respectful of each others level of knowledge, and compromise on design aspects of projects. 
  Being respectful to your partner includes: withstanding the urge to rip the keyboard away from your partner when you "know" the answer, withstanding the urge to talk over your partner, and listening. 
  
  Researched answer:

Driver-navigator is a proper paired programming technique. In this style of paired programming, one person "drives", controls the computer, while the other person "navigates", by instructing their partner on how to control the computer.

6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer:
  
  I am not entirely sure what the acronmn stands for, but I am guessing it has something to do with paired programming and alternating at timed intervals. 

  Researched answer:

TDD is Test Driven Development. 

In TDD, small lines of code are tested individually in order to avoid future debugging in big blocks of code. 

7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:

I found all the lectures and following activites very helpful. 
I also found taking notes during lectures to be very helpful, although we have everything in the syllabus, as I am someone who learns by doing, rather than listening.
